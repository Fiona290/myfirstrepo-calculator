# 🎉 Welcome to the Calculator! 🎉
# We're going to add, subtract, multiply, and divide two numbers

# Step 1: Ask the user to input the first number
# We're using 'float()' to make sure our numbers can have decimals too.
num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))

# Step 2: Ask the user to input the second number
# Same trick here—using 'float()' for decimal to be incorporated
num2 = float(input("Enter the second number: "))

# Step 3: Time to do some math! Computing the sum, difference, product, and quotient.

# Add the two numbers ➕
sum_result = num1 + num2

# Subtract the second number from the first ➖
difference_result = num1 - num2

# Multiply the two numbers ✖️
product_result = num1 * num2

# Divide the first number by the second  ➗
# We'll assume the user is not dividing by zero
quotient_result = num1 / num2

# Step 4: Show the user what they got
print(f"Results of your two numbers:")
print(f"Sum: {sum_result}")  # ➕
print(f"Difference: {difference_result}")  # ➖
print(f"Product: {product_result}")  # ✖️
print(f"Quotient: {quotient_result}")  # ➗

# 🏁 And that's it!
